我在读冰火的原著时，马丁老爷子在雪诺刚加入守夜人军团这一章节，对其性格转变的描写刷新了我对雪诺的认识. 这一章节不仅有唐纳.诺伊与雪诺的精彩对话, 而且而有着"相同身份"的小恶魔在这一章节对雪诺相助以及他们的对话都非常精彩. 总之, 这是我最喜欢的章节之一, 所以这里记录一下.

雪诺自认为身上流淌着着高贵的血液，加上从小生活环境的优越，所以刚到黑城堡时, 面对身边一群“差劲人”, 不仅独来独往，而且看不起身边的守夜人兄弟. 马丁老爷子在书中这样写道:

> John followed the rest back to the armory, walking alone. He often walked alone here. There were almost twenty in the group he trained with, yet not one he could call a friend. Most Were two or three years his senior, yet not one was half the fighter Robb had been at fourteen. Dareon was quick but afraid of being hit. Pyp used his sword like a dagger, Jeren was weak as a girl, Green slow and clumsy. ...... The more time he spent with them, the more Jon despised them.

甚至当唐纳.诺伊制止雪诺与 Grenn 等4人打架时，Donal Noye 告诉雪诺:

> A long life or a short one, it's up to you, Snow. The road you're walking, one of your brother will slit your throat for you one night


而雪诺反击说：

> They're not my brothers. They hate me because I'm better than they are

但是 Donal Noye 对他人讨厌雪诺的原因做了另一种解答：

> No. They hate you because you act like you're better than they are. They look at you and see a castle-bred basterd who thinks he's a lording.

更精彩的是，老爷子借 Donal Noye 之口进一步指出:

> Now think om this, boy. None of these others have ever had a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser. There fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers, smiths and miners and oars on a trading gallery. What they know of fighting they learned between deck, ...... but I promise you, not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword
 
> So how do you like the taste of your victories now, Lord Snow?

面对这样的问题，老爷子是这样描述善良的雪诺的反应的：

> "Don't call me that!" Jon said sharply, but the force had gone out of his anger. Suddenly he felt ashamed and guilth. "I never ... I didn't think ...

而在章节末，雪诺主动向 Grenn 表达善意. 大概从这一刻开始, 雪诺才开始真正融入守夜人兄弟.

雪诺身上流淌着高贵的血液, 有着高贵和善良的品质, 同时从小就被打上 "basterd" 的标签, 可以说雪诺即是一个幸运的人又是一个不幸的人. 所以当 Donal Noye 向他指出其他人没有雪诺优秀的根本原因是, 不是每一个人都可以像他一样幸运, 这个时候雪诺感到羞愧. 雪诺是一位真正懂得和理解好与坏的人, 所以他既能爱他高贵的兄弟姐妹们, 同时又能真正地爱着他的出身低微的守夜人兄弟们.
